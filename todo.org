* TODO Fix the "Time So Far" information  :Tasks: 
For the project that I am mostly crunching for while developing this, Enigma@Home, the Time So Far is always empty. 
However, upon further investigation of what BOINC's XML-RPC functionality provides, the functions that return tonnes of data, 
e.g. simple_gui_info, contains a populated elapsed_time field. For some reason this isn't provided by the get_results call 
that is currently made. 


* TODO Make tasks' deadline times indicate when deadline is near/exceeded :Tasks:

* TODO Add further details :HostInfo: [1/3]
** DONE Current CPU temperature
** TODO Load averages
** TODO I guess if I really want to, make these columns specific to unix-like OSes only.

* TODO Add the ability to be able to change global preferences :Preferences:

* TODO What happens if BOINC isn't running? :General:

* TODO What happens when various requests throw exceptions? :General: 
Need to review all requests in order to check. I've alreay dealt with many but doubtless there are more to do.


* TODO Make the statistics section of the project page into a directive :Project:

* TODO On the task page, add success/error feedback when tasks are resumed, suspended or aborted :Task:

* TODO When clicking "Don't Detach When Done", I am unable to subsequently detect that the project shouldn't be detached when done :Project: 
When I click "Detach When Done", it causes detach_when_done to appear in the project's XML. I can use that to determine whether 
I have requested to detach when done, as that element wasn't present before. However it remains even after I click 
"Don't Detach When Done". So how can I determine that I've asked to detach when done and then told BOINC not to? 
Is this a bug in BOINC?


* TODO Review filter drop-down  [0/2] 										 :Messages:
** TODO There is a filter for "(no project)" but nothing to reset the filter to display all messages
** TODO When I select "(no project)", I still seem to get a few messages that have a project filled in against them

* TODO The Message Type column seems to be usesless :Messages:
It's always either empty or "1". So seems like no need to have that column
* TODO Make the Project column a hyperlink to the row's project detail page :Messages:

* TODO I have various rows here that I don't know the meaning of [0/8] :Preferences:
** TODO max_ncpus_pct

** TODO Don't verify images
** TODO mod_time
** TODO Override file present -- what does the value mean?
** TODO suspend_if_no_recent_input
** TODO vm_max_used_pct

* TODO The link to task detail doesn't present a very big target on xs view :Tasks:

* TODO Highlight the fact that an unattached project supports the current platform :ProjectDetail:
1. Put a piece of text near the attach button saying so
2. In the list of platforms, either highlight the current platform or de-emphasize the others

* TODO Collapse the list of supported platforms, make them expandable :ProjectDetail:

* TODO Make the attach project dialog and attach project pages use common markup :Attach:Detach: 
i.e., make into a directive

* TODO Make the detach project dialog and detach project pages use common markup :Attach:Detach: 
i.e., make into a directive
* TODO When I try to attach to a project that doesn't support my platform, ask for confirmation :Attach:

e.g. Make ascending order give tasks ready to report, then aborted, then running, then waiting, then suspended

* TODO Round system uptime to nearest second :HostInfo:

* TODO Manage Account Managers [0/3] 									  :NewFeature:
At the moment I have to do all this via boinccmd or boincmgr
** TODO Attach to an account manager

Currently it seems to do this on BOINC client start/schedule only
