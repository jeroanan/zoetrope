* TODO Zoetrope TODO List [3/25]
** TODO Fix the "Time So Far" information										 :Tasks:
For the project that I am mostly crunching for while developing this, Enigma@Home, the Time So Far is always empty. 
However, upon further investigation of what BOINC's XML-RPC functionality provides, the functions that return tonnes of data, 
e.g. simple_gui_info, contains a populated elapsed_time field. For some reason this isn't provided by the get_results call 
that is currently made. 

** TODO Make tasks' deadline times indicate when deadline is near/exceeded :Tasks:
** TODO Add further details [0/2]											 :HostInfo:

*** TODO Load averages
*** TODO I guess if I really want to, make these columns specific to unix-like OSes only.
** TODO Add the ability to be able to change global preferences :Preferences:
** TODO What happens if BOINC isn't running?								  :General:
** TODO What happens when various requests throw exceptions?		  :General:
Need to review all requests in order to check. I've alreay dealt with many but doubtless there are more to do.

** TODO Add success/error feedback when tasks are resumed, suspended or aborted :Task:
** TODO When clicking "Don't Detach When Done", I am unable to subsequently detect that the project shouldn't be detached when done :Project:
When I click "Detach When Done", it causes detach_when_done to appear in the project's XML. I can use that to determine whether 
I have requested to detach when done, as that element wasn't present before. However it remains even after I click 
"Don't Detach When Done". So how can I determine that I've asked to detach when done and then told BOINC not to? 
Is this a bug in BOINC?

** TODO Review filter drop-down  [0/1] 									 :Messages:
