* TODO Fix the "Time So Far" information for tasks
For the project that I am mostly crunching for while developing this, Enigma@Home, the Time So Far is always empty. 
However, upon further investigation of what BOINC's XML-RPC functionality provides, the functions that return tonnes of data, 
e.g. simple_gui_info, contains a populated elapsed_time field. For some reason this isn't provided by the get_results call 
that is currently made.

* TODO Make tasks' deadline times indicate when deadline is near/exceeded

* TODO Add further details to the Host Info page [1/2]
** DONE Current CPU temperature
** TODO Load averages

* TODO Add the ability to be able to change global preferences

* TODO What happens if BOINC isn't running?

* TODO What happens when various requests throw exceptions?
Need to review all requests in order to check. I've alreay dealt with many but doubtless there are more to do.


* TODO Make the statistics section of the project page into a directive

* TODO On the task page, add success/error feedback when projects are resumed, suspended or aborted

* TODO When clicking "Don't Detach When Done", I am unable to detect subsequently that the project shouldn't be detached when doen
When I click "Detach When Done", it causes detach_when_done to appear in the project's XML. I can use that to determine whether 
I have requested to detach when done, as that element wasn't present before. However it remains even after I click 
"Don't Detach When Done". So how can I determine that I've asked to detach when done and then told BOINC not to? 
Is this a bug in BOINC?
